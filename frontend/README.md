# Sales Order Matching Application

This project is a web application that allows users to:

- Upload a Purchase Order PDF
- Extract line items from the PDF
- Match extracted items against a product catalog
- Allow manual corrections (Human-in-the-loop experience)
- Export matched sales orders as CSV
- Save and version sales orders (edit old ones without overwriting)
- View a dashboard of all processed sales orders
